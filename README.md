- It took me a long time to write the fetch to get the villagers and ended up using the example given on discord
- Generally struggled with trying to put parts together. Didn't implement components well for the villagers as this was all added directly to the page
- Had an issue with stopping the default selected element on my form from being an option as it was being submitted with an id of 0. Looked online and saw many responses but most disagreeing with each other and then the chrome console saying the way I had implemented it shouldnt be used. Ended up using a mix bewteen what a few different messages said online

- Also had issues with resetting my form on submit but that was me being silly, thinking it would be complicated instead of just having to set the state again
- Thought the delete button to remove a villager was not working but the information was being declared in the console, I realised it was only showing after the page had been refreshed. I could not work out how to remove the element immediately but realised after searching online that I needed to filter the elements after the handleDelete function

- I enjoyed making the assignment but I think I should've chosen a different direction with the app as while the relationships between the 2 db tables work, the info displayed isn't great and I could've come up with something better. I realised this a bit too late into making the project and was worried for time and whether I would've been able to implement what I wanted to in the first place
